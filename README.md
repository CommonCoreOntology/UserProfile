# My Data Ontology
> The My Data Ontology (MDO) is an extension of the [Common Core Ontologies (CCO)](https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies) that provides a standardized extensible semantics for representing personal data, such as that found in a user profile or wallet. As an extension of CCO, MDO also inherits and re-uses [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO) and [OBO Relation Ontology](https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations). Use of the methodology and standards derived from CCO, BFO, and RO, provides an integration layer for personal data that enables a transparent and unified semantics across domains and applications.

## Mapping Data Models to the My Data Ontology
1. Select a defined data model for personal information 
2. Categorized all the attributes of the data model into a table. See the example below:

    | Data Model   | Attributes              | Example |
    | ------------ | ----------------------- | ------|
    | NAVIGATIONAPP | Toll Preference (Tolls-OK or AvoidTolls | Tolls|  
    | Investopedia | Full Name               | John Doe |
    | Investopedia | Social Security Number  | 123 456 7890 |
    | Investopedia | Driverâ€™s license Number      | S1234567898765 |
    | Investopedia | Mailing address         | 21 Main St., Roosevelt Island, New York, NY, US |
    | Investopedia | Credit card Number | 2837362289292992 |
    | Investopedia | Passport information    | ?? |


3. Using the [My data ontology](https://github.com/I-AM-project/my-data-ontology/blob/master/MyDataOntology.ttl), create an ontological representation for all the attributes in the data model. Add the represention to the table. Below is an example for the first row. 

    | Data Model   | Attributes | My Data Ontology Representation                                   |
    | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Investopedia | Full Name  | cco:Person, cco:designated_by, cco:PersonGivenName, cco:has_value |

4. Complete the process until all the attributes have a corresponding representation.

# My Data Ontology
The My Data Ontology (MDO) is an extension of the [Common Core Ontologies (CCO)](https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies) that provides a standardized extensible semantics for representing personal data, such as that found in a user profile or wallet. As an extension of CCO, MDO also inherits and re-uses [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO) and [OBO Relation Ontology](https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations). Use of the methodology and standards derived from CCO, BFO, and RO, provides an integration layer for personal data that enables a transparent and unified semantics across domains and applications.

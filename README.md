# User Profile Ontology
The User Profile Ontology is an extension of the [Common Core Ontologies (CCO)](https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology/CommonCoreOntologies) that provides a standardized extensible semantics for representing information about a person’s profile. As an extension of CCO, the User Profile inherits and re-uses the [Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)](https://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO) and [OBO Relation Ontology.](https://github.com/oborel/obo-relations) Use of the methodology and standards derived from CCO, BFO, and RO, provides an integration layer for an individual’s profile data that maintains a transparent and unified semantics across domains and applications.

The User Profile Ontology relies on a standard set of semantic models for describing the information contained in a person’s profile. These models are repeatable across applications and, like the ontologies, are extended from those used in CCO, BFO, and RO. There are represented as data shapes using SHACL.

The genesis of the User Profile Ontology is to support a proposed [use case](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/JKReynolds-patch-1/user-profile/use-cases.md) for the [Solid Data Interoperability Panel](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/tree/JKReynolds-patch-1).
